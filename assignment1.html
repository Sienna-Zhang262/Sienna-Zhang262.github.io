        <p>Understanding Privacy, Security, and Media Ethics in the Digital Age
How communication technology affects your data — and how you can protect yourself</p>
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>We use social media, messaging apps, and school platforms every day, but rarely think about where our posts and messages go.
            I once shared a funny meme that got forwarded without me knowing.            
            Every post can carry hidden privacy risks and ethical responsibilities. 
            Being mindful of what we share is the first step to staying safer online.
        In this blog post, I will explore two essential topics:
        <br>
            <br>1. Privacy and Security Issues in Communication Technologies
            <br>2. Ethical Issues in Creating and Sharing Media
        <br>
        <br>I will also share personal examples and practical tips . By the end, you’ll have a clear understanding of how to navigate the digital 
        world safely and ethically.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>1. Privacy and Security Issues in Communication Technology
                <br>1.1 What Data Do Communication Apps Collect?</h2>
        <p>Many communication apps collect much more information than people usually expect. Even if an app says it does not “read” messages, it can still collect metadata, such as when messages are sent or who they are sent to, rather than the message content itself.
        <br>
        <br>Examples of commonly collected data:
        <br>
        <br>(a)Your location
        <br>(b)Who you talk to and how often
        <br>(c)Device information (model, IP address, operating system)
        <br>(d)Browsing habits and search activity
        <br>(e)Contacts and photos if permissions are granted
        <br>
        <br>Many users click “Allow” on permissions without reading them. In fact, according to a 2023 digital literacy study, 62% of teenagers 
        install apps without reviewing the privacy settings</p>
        <h2>1.2 Risks: Data Breaches, Hacking, and Tracking</h2>
        <img src="https://www.cyber.gc.ca/sites/default/files/images/ncta-2022-intro-fig1-motivations-e.jpg" width="560" hight="315">
        <p>When companies keep a lot of user data, they can be at risk of cyber attacks. If the data is leaked, people’s names, emails, phone numbers, and even private messages could be exposed.

        <br>A 2022 cybersecurity report found that over 422 million individuals were affected by data breaches in North America alone—a number that increases every year.
        <br>
        <br>What can happen if your data is leaked?
        <br>Advertising companies can track you across websites
        <br>Hackers can attempt password resets and identity theft
        <br>Strangers may obtain access to your social accounts
        <br>Your location history may become exposed
        <br>You may receive scam messages or phishing emails 
        <br>I once experienced a minor version of this when my old gaming account was compromised. Even though the account itself wasn’t important, the attacker tried using the same password to enter my email. That experience taught me how unsafe reused passwords are.</p>
        <h2>1.3 How to Protect Your Privacy and Security</h2>
        <p>a.Review App Permissions
        <br>Every month, check which apps use your camera, microphone, location, and contacts. Turn off anything unnecessary.
        <br>b.Use Strong, Unique Passwords
        <br>Never reuse the same password across multiple accounts. A password manager can help create and store strong passwords.
        <br>c.Turn On Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)
        <br>When possible, use 2FA. This adds an extra code sent to your phone so only you can log in.
        <br>d.Be Cautious With Public Wi-Fi
        <br>Avoid checking private information or logging into banking/important accounts on public networks.
        <br>e.Keep Software Updated
        <br>Updates often fix security vulnerabilities that attackers try to exploit.</p>
        <h2>2. Ethical Issues in Creating and Sharing Media</h2>
        <p>Communication technology isn’t only about protecting ourselves—it’s also about how our actions online affect other people. The way we share photos, videos, and messages reflects our judgment and respect for others.</p>
        <h2>2.1 Copyright and Proper Credit</h2>
        <p>Online media is easy to copy, screenshot, or repost. But just because something is easy to share doesn’t mean it’s legal or ethical.
        <br>
        <br>Examples of ethical violations include:
        <br>a.Reposting someone’s artwork without permission
        <br>b.Using an online photo for a school project without credit
        <br>c.Downloading copyrighted music for a video
        <br>d.Editing someone’s video clip and sharing it as your own
        <br>
        <br>Creators deserve recognition for their work. The ethical rule is simple:If it's not yours, ask permission or give proper credit.</p>
        <h2>2.2 Consent: Sharing Images of Others</h2>
        <p>One of the most important ethical principles online is consent. This applies especially to photos and videos involving other people.
<br>
            <br>You should always ask before posting:
<br>Photos of friends;
<br>Group pictures at school;
<br>Videos where faces are visible;
<br>Screenshots that show people’s names or messages.
<br>
<br>Failing to ask can cause embarrassment, unwanted attention, or even bullying. Many schools now teach students digital citizenship—and for good reason. Sharing images without consent can have long-term consequences.</p>

        <h2>2.3 Misinformation and Deepfakes</h2>
        <p>Ethical media use also means thinking critically before spreading information. With deepfake technology and AI editing tools, it has become easy to manipulate video or audio to make it seem real.
<br>
<br>Ethical digital citizens must:
<br>a.Verify information before sharing
<br>b.Check the source’s credibility
<br>c.Avoid forwarding rumors or unverified claims
<br>Understand that misinformation can harm real people
<br>
<br>A 2023 study from a major university found that one in three students has unknowingly shared information that turned out to be false. This shows how easy it is to spread misinformation without meaning to.</p>
        <h2>3. Practical Tips for Students</h2>
        <p>Here is a checklist you can follow to stay safe and ethical online:
<br>Privacy and Security Checklist
<br>Review app permissions
<br>Use different passwords for every account
<br>Turn on 2FA
<br>Update apps and devices regularly
<br>Avoid public Wi-Fi for important tasks
<br>Ethics Checklist
<br>Ask before sharing photos of others
<br>Give credit for images, videos, and music
<br>Double-check sources before sharing news
<br>Avoid editing or altering others’ media without permission
<br>Report harmful content instead of reposting it
<br>
<br>These small habits build a safer and more respectful online environment for everyone.</p>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>Communication technologies give us incredible opportunities to connect, learn, and create. But with these opportunities come responsibilities. By understanding privacy risks, protecting our personal information, and practicing ethical media behavior, we can become more thoughtful digital citizens. The more educated we are about online safety and ethics, the more confident—and safer—we become when navigating the online world.</p>
