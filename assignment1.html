        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Every day, we use communication technologies—social media, messaging apps, school platforms—without thinking about what happens to the information we share. But behind every message, photo, or post, there are privacy risks and ethical responsibilities that affect both us and the people around us. Understanding these issues is the first step toward becoming a safer, more responsible digital citizen.In this blog post, I will explore two essential topics:

            1，Privacy and Security Issues in Communication Technologies
            2，Ethical Issues in Creating and Sharing Media
I will also share personal examples and practical tips . By the end, you’ll have a clear understanding of how to navigate the digital world safely and ethically.</p>
        <h2>1. Privacy and Security Issues in Communication Technology

            1.1 What Data Do Communication Apps Collect?</h2>
        <p>Most communication tools collect far more information than we realize. Even when apps claim they don’t “read your messages,” they often collect metadata—information about your messages rather than the content itself.

Examples of commonly collected data:

(a)Your location

(b)Who you talk to and how often

(c)Device information (model, IP address, operating system)

(d)Browsing habits and search activity

(e)Contacts and photos if permissions are granted

Many users click “Allow” on permissions without reading them. In fact, according to a 2023 digital literacy study, 62% of teenagers install apps without reviewing the privacy settings</p>
